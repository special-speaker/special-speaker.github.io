          Nita Evans hosts a podcast called, &ldquo;The Chat with Nita Evans.&rdquo; The show
          originates from <a href="https://www.wygs.org">the WYGS station in
          Columbus, Indiana</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the show, Nita chats with women from all walks of life who are followers of Jesus Christ and active in their daily pursuit of making a difference for Christ.
        </p>

        <p>
          The word chat means &ldquo;a friendly informal conversation,&rdquo; and this is exactly what Nita has with her guest each week as she talks with them about what their walk of faith looks like on a daily basis. Their chat includes the guests testimony, prayer and devotional life, life verse, favorite Biblical accounts, mentors, struggles and much more.
